Files to edit
-------------

Weekly reports:

    report/week*.pdf

Tasks:

    mf*/mf.cc


Quick start
-----------

Let us use task MF1 as an example:

    cd mf1
    make test

The test should fail, as we have not implemented the median filter
subroutine yet. Now open the file `mf.cc` in a text editor and
fill in the missing details. Then compile it:

    make

Run the test suite:

    make test

And do some benchmarking to see that it performs well:

    make benchmark

In the benchmarks, the last column is the running time in seconds.
For more thorough benchmarks, try:

    make benchmark2


Environment
-----------

We will assume the following:

 - Operating system: Linux or Mac OS X.

 - Compiler: GCC version 4.9 or 4.8, somewhere in the path,
   with the name `g++-4.9`, `g++-4.8`, or `g++`.

 - Libraries: libpng installed in a location where GCC can find it.

For assembly output, you also need `objdump` and `c++filt`.


### Classroom computers

Everything should work directly in the classroom computers (Maari-A).


### Your own computers

To run this on your own OS X computer, try the following:

 - Install Homebrew: http://brew.sh/

 - Run: `brew install gcc libpng binutils`

To run this on your own Ubuntu 14.04 Linux computer, try the
following:

 - Run: `sudo apt-get install g++-4.8 libpng12-dev`


Advanced: debug builds
----------------------

Disable optimisations:

    cd mf1
    make clean
    make DEBUG=1
    make test

Disable optimisations and enable address sanitizer
(helps to catch many memory access errors):

    cd mf1
    make clean
    make DEBUG=2
    make test

Remember to run `make clean` afterwards.


Advanced: see the assembly code
-------------------------------

To see the assembly code generated by the compiler, try the targets
`*.asm1` or `*.asm2`. Example:

    cd mf1
    make mf.asm1
    make mf.asm2

Open the files `mf.asm1` and `mf.asm2` in a text editor.

The first file is the assembly code produced by the compiler for
the file `mf.cc`, with some post-processing to make it more readable
(name demangling).

The second file is a disassembly of the object file `mf.o`, interleaved
with the source code from `mf.cc`.

Search for `mf(` to find the code related to function `mf()`.

The assembly code may not be that easy to read. You can try to see
what it looks like without optimisation:

    cd mf1
    make clean
    make DEBUG=1 mf.asm1
    make DEBUG=1 mf.asm2
